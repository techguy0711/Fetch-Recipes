d you choose to focus on these areas?

### Focus Areas
I prioritized performence and archetecture as these things can keep an app behaving smooth and easily maintainable.
### Time Spent
Took me about 2 hours to complete entire project.
### Trade-offs and Decisions
I would have loved to support better landscape UI and instead of just iOS I could add vision pro and iPad support.
### Weakest Part of the Project
The weakest part is Unit testing, I could add more test cases for specific scenarios like failure and empty recipes array.
### Additional Information
I added the accessibility identifiers for the name and cusine text's so that if I want to add UI tests I can use the identifier to get what the text says.
